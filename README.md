# Retrieving-Twitter-Archive-Data
This Spyder based Python coding has been developed for Trip Production Modeling of Small City. 
Trip Production Model is part of Trip Generation Model in Transportation Demand Models.
The program requires Twitter API Bearer Token for Academic purpose (in line 18). 
Target data in terms of date can be arranged within the coding (line 44 and line 55).
This program gives 4 options to handle data.
Retrieved data can directly be saved into MongoDb (option 1).
In case you already have data in a CSV file need to save into MongoDb (option 2).
In case you already have data in a folder with xlsx files need to save into MongoDb (option 3).
In case you need to convert data from xlsx into csv format then save into MongoDb (option 4).
When you apply option 1, you will get output in an xlsx file also.
